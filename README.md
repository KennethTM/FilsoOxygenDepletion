# FilsoOxygenDepletion

Code used for the analysis and figures in the paper in [Science of the Total Environment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720335920).

During the summer 2018 all fish in the southern part Filsø died suddenly. The event occurred after a long period of drought followed by a sudden rain event. This caused a high inflow of water, and along with it, a large pulse of organic matter which rapidly increased respiration rates within the lake and caused anoxia within few days.
